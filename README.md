Title: Forecasting Product Trends for E-commerce Businesses
Objective:
To develop a data-driven forecasting system that identifies emerging product trends in the e-commerce market, enabling businesses to make proactive inventory, marketing, and sales decisions.
Background:
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, staying ahead of consumer demand is crucial. Businesses often struggle with overstocking or understocking products due to unpredictable market trends. Leveraging historical sales data, web analytics, and social media signals can provide valuable insights into future product demand and trends.
Scope of the Project:
•	Collect and process historical sales data from e-commerce platforms.
•	Integrate external data sources such as Google Trends, social media platforms, and competitor listings.
•	Apply machine learning and time series forecasting models to predict future demand and identify trending products.
•	Visualize trends through dashboards and reports for business decision-makers.
Key Features:
•	Trend detection for product categories and SKUs.
•	Forecasting model using ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM.
•	Integration of real-time signals (e.g., search volume, hashtags).
•	Alert system for upcoming trends and stock recommendations.
Expected Outcomes:
•	Improved inventory management based on demand forecasts.
•	Increased sales through early adoption of product trends.
•	Reduced losses from overstock and missed sales opportunities.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Facebook Prophet, LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)
•	APIs (Google Trends, Twitter, e-commerce platforms)
•	Power BI / Tableau / Dash for data visualization
•	AWS / Azure for cloud-based deployment (optional)
